                <p>
                    I have been teaching foreign languages for 25 years. I graduated from the Linguistic  University of Minsk (Belarus) in 1986 and got a diploma Teacher of English and German (BA). In 2012 I graduated from Antwerpen University where I had studied Dutch. 
                    I've taught students of all ages and adults in both state and private schools. Besides classes at school I also worked as a private teacher specializing in preparing school-leavers for entrance exams at higher educational establishments.
                    Working as a Vice-Principal and a Headteacher of Foreign languages Department at one Grammar school I was responsible for working out curriculum,  preparation of test materials. I was in charge of textbooks’ selection.  
                </p>
                <p>
                    My favourite approach is communicative and interactive, I've always been interested in teaching with technology. That’s why online classes are so interesting for me. I find it extremely essential that students can take my lessons regardless of location, they don’t have to spend time on going to school.
                    Due to my flexibility my students can have lessons also on week-ends any time suitable for them. This way of teaching and studying  is the most effective.
