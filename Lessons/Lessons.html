                <h1>How the system works?</h1>
                <p>
                    In case you get interested in this offer we can arrange our first meeting on Skype. I would like to know your reason of studying the language, your motivation, expectations from the course.
                    Depending upon your final goal we will try to suppose the duration of the course (but  approximately).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many factors will influence it: (frequency of lessons –minimum 2 per week, max -4), your personal perception of the material. We’ll agree on a trial lesson of 20-30  min (free of charge).
                    After this first lesson you can  send an  e-mail me or send a message on Skype if we can start our cooperation  or you won’t take the lessons (mentioning  the reason is not necessary).
                </p>

                <h1>What is the lesson?</h1>
                <p>
                    A student and a teacher both work for achieving a result. Any language is a system. Efficiency of studying a foreign language depends upon a system, the one which can fully correspond with a person, his needs, his abilities...<br />
                    Being a tutor after the trial lesson I make a curriculum taking into consideration your existing level of knowledge, your needs. <br />
                    Either it’s a conversational language, or business language (English, Russian), the language for travelling…
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each lesson starts with so-called “ice-breaker” - conversation on any topic (a student can choose it or a teacher offers him any). The aim of this task is to develop and improve skills received at previous lessons.
                    Communicative method of teaching involves students into the process, helps overcome language barrier, makes students more confident in their acquired knowledge, motivates them.
                    The main aim of any foreign language is to communicate that’s why an accent on conversational skills is made. But to sound grammatically correct and respectively towards other people is impossible without grammar rules.
                    Video fragments, short films, podcasts dubbed by native speakers are foreseen to be included into lessons. All lessons last 60 minutes.
                </p>
